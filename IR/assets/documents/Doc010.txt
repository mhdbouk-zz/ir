Given the uncertainty surrounding a new event, recipients called one another to determine who was going to attend. Many were intrigued. Eventually, the planners had lined up Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Branson, Mr. Schwarzman and the chief executive of BlackRock, Laurence D. Fink, who was recently featured on the cover of Barron’s with the headline “The New Conscience of Wall Street?”

The Saudis recruited Richard Attias, a well-known conference organizer, who co-founded the Clinton Global Initiative and updated the look of Davos in the 1990s. Mr. Attias, a Moroccan, has also worked for media organizations like Bloomberg — organizing its forthcoming conference in Singapore — as well as The Times.

Among its biggest lures was the windfall from an initial public offering of the Saudi state oil company, Saudi Aramco, which was expected to be worth more than $100 billion. Mr. Trump, in particular, was eager to see Aramco listed in the United States. (In August, the Saudi government delayed the deal, though Crown Prince Mohammed insists it could still happen by 2021.)
