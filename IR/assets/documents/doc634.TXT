establishment of a turkey flock free of 'n' strain mycoplasma
mycoplasma of the 'n' strain are frequently isolated from
turkey poults affected with airsacculitis but free of
mycoplasma gallisepticum.  research on the 'n' strain has
been impeded by the presence of a high proportion of
turkey poults with airsacculitis in all breeding flocks
examined, by the difficulty of culturing and identifying
the mycoplasma strains, and by the lack of a practical
serologic test.  this communication describes the establishment
of a small nucleus of 'n'-free turkeys from a commercial
breeding flock known to carry 'n' mycoplasma.
hens and toms for the production of 'n'-free poults were
selected from the parent flock by serology and culture.
