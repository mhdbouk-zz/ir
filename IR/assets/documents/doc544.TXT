potassium deficiency in the male rat at the time of weaning,
provokes an increase in the weight of the suprarenals, an
atrophy of the glomerular zone and a lipoid hypertrophy of
the fasciculae.
it causes a rise in the level of the blood cholesterol.  it
reduces the phosphate level in the blood and increases the
phosphate in the urine.
the blood calcium level is not altered but a hypocalciuria is
noted.
it leads to a severe osteopathy which has been investigated
by radiography, microradiography and histological and bio-
chemical study of the skeleton.  the following are the charac-
teristics : arrest of osseous growth, delay of maturation, arrest
of chondrogenesis, formation of dense metaphyseal lines or
lines of arrest, osteoporosis.
these facts are discussed and compared to the analogous
changes found in the syndrome of chronic idiopathic hypo-
kalaemia with hyperkaluria in the infant.
