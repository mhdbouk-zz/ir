infantile autism: a family approach
the autistic child appears to be unable to integrate or to respond to
stimuli, both from an internal source, the body, as well as from external
sources, such as human contact.  we have noted in the children at our
residential treatment center how in their preliminary period with us they
appear to be unaware of their body; they give the impression of being
insensitive to pain, display little autoerotic behavior, inflict injury on
themselves, such as hitting their heads against objects and biting their own
bodies, with little outward display of distress.  in working with these
children in therapy, one of the guideposts for change and for growth is a
display on the child's part of an increased body awareness and autoerotic
behavior.  for example, one child who developed polio during his early stay
at the clinic residence did not communicate this to anyone and it was only
made known by observing the child's dragging one leg (memorial guid-
ance clinic, 1959).  later, he was able to point to his body and to indicate
pain.  another child, who at first seemed to be quite unaware of both himself
and others, concurrent with his growing display of affective expression
toward the therapist also manifested pleasure through genital stimulation,
was quite ticklish, and when injured would display the area of pain quite
readily.
