the natural history of autoimmune
disease in nzb mice
a comparison with the pattern of human
autoimmune manifestations
all mice of the nzb/bl strain spon-
taneously develop serological and
pathological evidence of autoimmune dis-
ease during adult life.  the nzb/bl strain
was developed by dr. marianne bielschow-
sky in dunedin, new zealand, by inbreed-
ing from an outbred colony of mixed coat
color.  several inbred strains--nzb, nzc,
nzo, nzw, nzy, and others, have been
evolved in dunedin from the original col-
ony.  evidence for autoimmune disease in
the nzb strain was first reported by
bielschowsky, helyer, and howie who
found evidence of an autoimmune hemo-
lytic anemia.  the dunedin group used the
presence of agglutinins for ficin-treated red
cells as the index of the disease.
