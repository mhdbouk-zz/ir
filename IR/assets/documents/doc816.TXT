the convergence and interaction of visual,
auditory, and tactile responses in human
nonspecific cortex
the relation between the electrical responses in the human brain and
mental processes of integration and association is perhaps the most chal-
lenging of all the problems facing neurophysiologists today.  until quite
recently the prospect of unifying physiological and psychological concepts
by electro-encephalographic (eeg) techniques seemed to be receding
because of the baffling complexity of the intrinsic electrical rhythms, and
this difficulty has still not been overcome.  the most intriguing, and at
the same time most elusive, of the properties of these rhythms is that,
although often remarkably constant in their variations with respect to
time, they fluctuate also, in a much less regular manner, within the three
dimensional space of the brain.  the continuous analysis and display of
such a phenomenon presents serious difficulties, and no method has yet
given entirely satisfactory results.
the incentive to construct adequate equipment and to design and per-
form crucial experiments is undoubtedly limited by the uncertainty as
to whether the information likely to be obtained in this way is essential
to understanding brain mechanisms; few experimenters imagine that it
would be sufficient.
