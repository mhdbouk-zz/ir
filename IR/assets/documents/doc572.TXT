pheochromocytoma
without hypertension
the patient developed symptoms of pheochromo-
cytoma about 15 years after the diagnosis of
eosinophilic adenoma of the pituitary gland.  the
predominating symptoms were profuse sweating
and tachycardia.  hypertension, hyperglycemia, and
glycosuria were absent.  the relation of the quan-
tity and the relative composition of catechol
amines to the symptomatology is discussed.  some
speculation regarding the etiological importance of
hypersecretion of growth hormone in pheochromo-
cytoma seems to be in order.
