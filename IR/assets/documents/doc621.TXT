otologic care of cleft palate cases
the purpose of this study was to review the ear pathology
in 480 patients whose cleft palates had previously been repaired.
despite concern over speech regression, tonsil and
adenoid surgery was carried out on 66 of these patients.  when
carefully done, this was accomplished with considerable overall
improvement, particularly for the benefit of the conductive
hearing loss.
sixteen cases had exact documentation of these results by
virtue of speech recording and accurate audiometric records.
