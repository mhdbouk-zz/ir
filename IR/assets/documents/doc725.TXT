urinary excretion of i131-diodrast injected intraventricularly
in communicating hydrocephalus and aqueduct stenosis
nine cases of expansive infantile hydro-
cephalus were investigated by injecting
small amounts of i131-diodrast intra-
ventricularly.  urinary excretion of the
tracer was determined during the first
4-5 hours after injection.  the cumulative
excretion of diodrast from the c.s.f. dif-
fers in cases with communicating hydro-
cephalus from those with stenosis of the
aqueduct.  the investigation is rapid and
easily performed and has not produced any
side effects.
