combined 5-fluorouracil and supervoltage
radiation therapy in the palliative manage-
ment of advanced gastrointestinal cancer:
a pilot study
malcolm y. colby, margaret a. holbrook
5-fluorouracil in combination with supervoltage radiation
therapy was employed in the palliative treatment of 44 pa-
tients with advanced gastrointestinal carcinoma.
a total dose of from 40 to 50 mg. per kilogram of body
weight of 5-fluorouracil given by rapid intravenous injection
at the onset of radiation therapy was found to be relatively
safe and tolerable.  larger doses were associated with excessive
toxicity and mortality.
a sufficient number of patients achieved objective and
subjective palliation to justify controlled study of the possible
additive or synergistic role that 5-fluorouracil may have when
combined with radiation therapy.
