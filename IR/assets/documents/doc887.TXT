speech as a landmark in development.
it is attempted to demonstrate how observations
of children's speech and language
development may serve as valuable indicators of
their general physical, intellectual,
and emotional progress.  speech lag or breakdown
may corroborate other suspect
areas of development or may point the way to them.
speech and language disorders
seldom originate in the mouth.  ideas must precede
speech, and speech is a direct
correlate of intelligence.
