familial renal diabetes insipidus.
renal diabetes insipidus has been known
for 20 yr. only.  the first german report
on such a case appeared in 1957.  nevertheless
this disease appears to be more
frequent, also in germany.  a report is
given on 4 infants from 2 families with a
verified diagnosis.  in the one family there
were 3 other cases with the features
of the disease (polydipsia, polyuria, low
sg of the urine).  in the other family
anamnestic studies revealed 5 such cases.
