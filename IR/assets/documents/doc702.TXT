hydrocephalus due to unrecognized cerebellar
astrocytoma treated by ventriculoatrial
shunt for four years
a case of a 9-year-old girl is presented in whom prolonged palliation of signs
of increased intracranial pressure, presumed to be due to aqueductal
obstruction, was achieved by means of a ventriculoatrial shunt.  four years
after placement of the shunt, signs of a cerebellar mass became apparent.
the neoplasm, a cystic astrocytoma, was subsequently totally resected and
the shunt was removed.  air studies demonstrating diminution of ventricular
size within this four year period are compared.
