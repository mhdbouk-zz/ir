cyclophosphamide in the management of
advanced bronchial carcinoma
forty patients suffering from advanced bronchial
carcinoma who were treated with cyclophospha-
mide are reviewed.  the selective effect of the drug
in tumours of the oat-cell type is noted.  it is
suggested that relapses which occur while the
patient is on oral maintenance therapy may be
controlled by a further intravenous course of
cyclophosphamide.
full clinical and statistical details of all the
patients referred to in this paper are available on
application to the author.
