The chief executive of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, was the most dramatic withdrawal. In an anguished phone call late last week with the conference’s sponsor, Yasir Al Rumayyan, Mr. Khosrowshahi, who is Iranian-American, told him that the allegations about Mr. Khashoggi were “terrible,” and that he would not go to Riyadh unless the questions about his fate were cleared up, according to two people briefed on the conversation.

Mr. Al Rumayyan, whose Saudi fund has invested more than $3.5 billion in Uber and who holds a seat on the company’s board, tried to assure him that the reports were not true, these people said, in keeping with the Saudi government’s denial of any involvement in Mr. Khashoggi’s disappearance. But it did not change his decision.
