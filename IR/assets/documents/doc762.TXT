impaired development of rat liver enzyme activities at
birth after irradiation in utero
development of activity of three liver enzymes at birth was studied in rats re-
ceiving 180 rads of x-rays on day 15 of gestation.  at 20 days of gestation,
activities of lactic and glycerophosphate dehydrogenases and
glucose-6-phosphatase were not altered.  the subsequent increases in enzyme
activities in the 3 days between 20 days of gestation and 1 day of age were
only 30 to 60% of those observed in controls.  this finding suggests that
irradiation in utero may alter later development of enzyme activity in the
perinatal period.
