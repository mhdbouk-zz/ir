vergleichende renale phosphatelearance-untersuchungen
beim hyperparathyreoidismus und beim sog.  phosphatdiabetes
the analysis of the function of the kidneys give a contribution to
the pathophysiology of two different diseases of general osteopathies
whose pathogenesis or etiology are still not clear in some points.  the
phosphate clearance pre- and postoperative in one patient with hyper-
parathyroidism showed that after the removal of the adenoma of the
parathyroid the renal reabsorption of phosphate improved only tempo-
rary as a secondary form of hyperparathyroidism was already present.
in a patient with a "phosphatdiabetes" the clearance examination showed
that under a high dosage of vitamin d the reabsorption of phosphate did
not increase.  based on these results we have not continued therapy
with vitamin d which is certainly not indifferent.  comparative renal
clearance examinations were carried out in 10 patients which did not
show any disturbances of calcium/phosphate-metabolism.
