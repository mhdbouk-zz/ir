hypoglycemia, growth retardation, and probable
isolated growth hormone deficiency in a
1-year-old child
a heretofore unreported association of defects, namely hypoglycemia, growth
retardation, and deficiency of serum growth hormonelike activity in a
1-year-old child is described.  human growth hormone (hgh), 3 mg. a day for 7
days, doubled the fasting blood sugar, prevented the postprandial hypoglycemia,
and reversed the sensitivity to tolbutamide and leucine.  treatment with 1 mg.
of hgh 3 times a week produced a growth of 7 inches in 3 months compared to a
growth of 1 inch in the previous 13 months.  since the protein-bound-iodine and
the response to methopyrapone were normal and the blood level of growth hormone
was low, this case is presented as a probable isolated growth hormone
deficiency.
