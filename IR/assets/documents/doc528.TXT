2127. selenium toxicity in domestic animals
the article, with an extensive bibliography, is a compendium of available
information on selenium toxicity in domestic animals.  literature reveals
evidence of organically bound se being more biologically active, when given
orally to domestic animals, than inorganic se salts.  there is also variation
in toxicity of organic se analogs.  when exposed to ruminal digestion, there is
considerable reduction of se salts to the relatively biologically inactive
elemental se; which may result in fecal excretion of se, as such, to as much
as 40% of a single oral dose.  fluorine, molybdenum, chromium, vanadium,
cadmium, zinc, cobalt, nickel and uranium increase se toxicity.  arsenic and
tungsten give some protection against it.  bromobenzene, benzene, and
napthalene
mobilize tissue se and stimulate its excretion.  since se preparations designed
for topical application in treatment of skin disease have been available for
use
in both man and dogs, the literature has reported cases of poisoning from
misuse
of such preparations.  selenium, properly used, can be a valuable therapeutic
agent, though certain salts of se must be regarded as potentially toxic.
however, there is considerable latitude between therapeutic and/or nutritional
and toxic doses of these salts.
