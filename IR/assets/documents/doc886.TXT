childhood echolalia in delayed, psychotic and neuropathologic
speech patterns.
some linguistic analytical procedures and
preliminary findings from controlled tape-recorded
samples of a group of echolalic
children are reported together with the
clinical and experimental rationale for the
investigation.  the subjects are echolalic
3-yr. olds and a group of young clinical referrals
representing a variety of pathological
conditions.  variables selected for
study include the proportion of echo to
non-echo and silence, the quality and appropriateness
of the non-echoed speech, the
amount of the stimulus echoed, the nature
of the triggering stimulus, the deviation of
echo pattern from stimulus pattern, pitch-loudness-time
variations, and the child's
chronological and mental ages.  early quantitative
results yielded very similar echo:
non-echo:silence percentages with echolalia
representing a mean of about 40% of the
conversation of each experimental group.
