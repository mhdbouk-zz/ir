1066. the effect of lymphoid cells from
the lymph of specifically immunised sheep
on the growth of primary sarcomata in
rats
the growth of primary fibrosarcomata induced in
rats with 3:4-benzpyrene was retarded by the injection
of lymphocytes obtained from the efferent duct of a
lymph node in a sheep immunized with a piece of the
tumor to be treated.  the action of the heterologous lym-
phocytes was specific to the particular tumor used for
immunization suggesting that reaction against tumor-
specific antigens is involved.  the cells responsible are
believed to be medium-sized pyroninophilic lymphocytes
which may stimulate the immune system of the host to
react against the autochthonous tumor.
