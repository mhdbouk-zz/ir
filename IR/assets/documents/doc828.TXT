la plasmatherapie a minima dans le traitement de la
douleur des hemarthroses hemophiliques
some fifty clinically similar cases of hemophilic hemarthrosis were, after
immobilization, either treated with placebo and plasma perfusion or else with
corticoids and analgesics.
a very small quantity of plasma is sufficient to stop the pain for the
following few hours.
it is attempted to give a physio-pathologic explanation which would seem in
accord with the pathogenic studies on hemophiliac by r. marx et al.
