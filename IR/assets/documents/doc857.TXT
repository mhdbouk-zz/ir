effect of heparin and parathyroid extract an acid phosphatase in bone.
   to test the theory that heparin
might stimulate acid
phosphatase in the bone of
young rats, heparin, pte,
or a combination of both were
injected.  after an appropriate
time interval acid phosphatase
activity of bone of
treated animals was compared
with controls.  it was
found that heparin enhanced
the pte-stimulated acid
phosphatase activity of both
calvaria and metaphysis but
not diaphysis.  the possible
relation of these facts to
the presence of lysosomes in
osteoclasts was discussed.
