red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency--a newly
recognized cause of neonatal jaundice and kernicterus in canada
seven male newborns of chinese, greek and
italian origin presented with severe hemo-
lytic jaundice due to red cell glucose-6-
phosphate dehydrogenase (g-6-pd) defi-
ciency.  in five, the hemolysis was precipi-
tated by inhalation of mothball vapours in
the home.  kernicterus was evident upon
admission in six infants and was fatal in
four of these.
g-6-pd deficiency should be suspected as
a cause of jaundice in all full-term male
infants of these ethnic groups.  the diag-
nosis can be confirmed in any hospital by
the methemoglobin reduction test.  in areas
similar to toronto, canada, where these
high-risk ethnic groups prevail, the follow-
ing measures are recommended: (1) detec-
tion of g-6-pd deficient newborns by
screening cord bloods of all infants of these
ethnic groups: (2) protection of affected
infants from potentially hemolytic agents
such as naphthalene, certain vitamin k
preparations, and sulfonamides; and (3) ob-
servation of serum bilirubin levels to assess
the need for exchange transfusion for hyper-
bilirubinemia.
