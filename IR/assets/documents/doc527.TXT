843. reactions of seleno- and sulfoamino acids with hydroperoxides
reactions of methionine, cystine and their selenium analogues with
hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides have been studied.  methionine reacts
most rapidly with hydrogen peroxide but selenocystine causes the most
decomposition; both react much more slowly with organic peroxides.  the results
suggest that selenocystine may act as a biological antioxidant.
