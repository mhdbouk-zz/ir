cineradiographic comparison of normal to noncleft subjects with velopharyngeal
inadequacy
cineradiographic studies of the normal subjects were compared with
studies of noncleft subjects who demonstrated velopharyngeal inadequacy.
the following conclusions were made: a) there was a significant difference
between soft palate length in normals and the velopharyngeal inadequacy
group.  b) there was not a significant difference between depth of nasopharynx
in normal and the velopharyngeal inadequacy group.  c) the
difference of the means of the soft palate length and depth of nasopharynx
between the normals and velopharyngeal inadequacy group was significant.
d) the thickness of the soft palate was greater in the normal than the
abnormal group.  e) in 70% of the normal and velopharyngeal inadequacy
groups the height of soft palate elevation was above the palatal plane.   f)
in 80% of the normal group the height of velopharyngeal closure took
place below the palatal plane.  none of the subjects in the velopharyngeal
inadequacy group obtained velopharyngeal closure.  g) there was no significant
correlation between amount of gap and voice quality.  h) there was
no significant correlation between amount of gap and intelligibility of
speech.  i) there was a difference between vital capacity readings for the
velopharyngeal inadequacy group with nose occluded and unoccluded.  j)
the correlation coefficient between quality judgment and intelligibility
judgment was highly significant.
