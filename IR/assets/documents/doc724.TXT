infantile hydrocephalus and hematoma in the posterior fossa
we have presented a case of hydrocephalus in
an infant, the basic cause being intracranial
hemorrhage in the perinatal period.  surgical re-
moval of a hematoma in the posterior fossa did not
give permanent relief of the raised intracranial
pressure.  a lumbar air study at this stage dis-
closed information that the passage through the
intracerebral cerebrospinal-fluid pathways was
normalized whereas the extracerebral ones still
were occluded by arachnoiditis.  the condition
necessitated a ventriculo-atrial shunt.
