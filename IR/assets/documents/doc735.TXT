development of dirofilaria immitis in anopheles quadri-
maculatus after exposure of the microfilariae to a
freezing temperature
blood samples containing dirofilaria
immitis microfilariae were stored frozen for
periods ranging from 24 hr to 4 months,
thawed at 38 1c and
fed through an animal-derived bandrode membrane to laboratory-reared anopheles
quadrimaculatus.  the microfilariae were capable of developing to the third or
infective larval stage and migrating to the head and labium of the mosquito.
