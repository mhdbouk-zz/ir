septicemia due to mycoplasma hominis type 1
viola m. young, ph.d., and sheldon m. wolff, m.d.
a febrile illness that followed therapeutic abortion
and was accompanied by the presence of
mycoplasma hominis type 1 in the blood is described.
the patient upon recovery exhibited a specific
antibody response to the mycoplasma isolated
from the blood, as well as to another strain of the
same serotype.  these findings are regarded as additional
evidence for the pathogenicity of m. hominis
type 1 organisms, particularly in situations favoring
their dissemination from the female genital
tract.
