biliary tract morphology and prognosis
of biliary atresia
in 86 infants who did not have extrahepatic "hepatic" ducts, present
observation after use of artificial
bile ducts suggests that the presence of the
gallbladder may be of good prognostic significance in biliary atresia.
there are 11 long-term survivors (as of october 1965) up to 8 1/4 years of
age (100 months) after use of artificial bile ducts in 86 babies.  a
gallbladder was identified in 10 of the 11 infants.
other specific factors for this prolonged survival pattern in these infants
with biliary atresia have not yet been identified, although suggestive
correlations among minimal hepatic fibrosis, maximal bile ductule
proliferations and the presence of the gallbladder were noted.
it is suspected that if any opportunity for long-term survivals exists for
infants to overcome the tragic occurrence of biliary atresia that the
surgeon should avoid trauma to the hepatic pedicle.
we may be able to provide a "guarded" rather than a "pessimistic" prog-
nosis when the gallbladder is found in the babies with biliary atresia.
