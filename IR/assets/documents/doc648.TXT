chromosome changes in human diploid-cell cultures infected
with mycoplasma
this communication shows that mycoplasma may also
change cell chromosomes, and therefore emphasizes the
need for caution in interpreting experimental results
without adequately testing for the presence
of mycoplasma.  chromosome damage similar
to that described here has been induced by
viruses in cell cultures and in blood cul-
tures.  chromosomal abnormalities have
also been reported in blood cultures and bone
marrow from leukaemic patients.
