growth and growth retardation
various attempts have been made over the years to define growth.  from
the standpoint of this review, growth is the physiological accretion of new
tissue which is reflected in the acquisition of protein and water.  this
process in almost all instances leads to increase in size (length, weight, and
volume) and actively progresses from the fertilization of the ovum to the
period of sexual maturity where millions of cells are present in a state of
advanced organization.  with further time, growth is less and, indeed, may
become negative insofar as cells are lost.
