shadow therapy
shadow therapy was developed at sunland
training center in gainesville, florida, because of communica-
tion difficulties with disturbed, psychotic children.  it was con-
jectured that subjects would reveal their anxieties and conflicts
more readily in a simulated night situation.
the therapy was conducted in a darkroom with projector
light used to produce silhouettes and their accompanying
shadows as additional stimuli.  twelve subjects attended.  in
this article, the reaction of a child who was autistic and severely
disturbed is used as an illustration of subject reactions.  in the
playroom, he exhibited static behavior; in the darkroom, re-
gressive-transcendential behavior.  he also transcended his usual
level of vocalizing and socializing.
