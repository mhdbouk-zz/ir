mansonia crassipes as the natural vector of filarioids, plasmodium gallinaceum
and other plasmodia of fowls in ceylon
it would appear from these
observations that m.
crassipes is the natural vector of
p. gallinaceum of fowls
in ceylon and possibly of other
species of plasmodium of
fowls or of related avian hosts.
if one of the other
plasmodia from m. crassipes is
in fact p. lophurae
then this will be the first record
of p. lophurae from
this part of the world.  we are,
however, not certain
whether the fowl is the natural
vertebrate host of
p. lophurae in ceylon.
we have seen crithidial forms in
the midgut of engorged
wild-caught m. crassipes.  this
mosquito may, therefore,
prove to be the vector of the
trypanosome as well.  the
trypanosome differs from
trypanosoma gallinarum and
t. calmettei which have previously
been reported from
fowls.
