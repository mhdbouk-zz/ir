esophageal obstruction
the use of an endoscopically inserted tube in the
care of esophageal carcinoma
our experience suggests that the en-
doscopic insertion of intraluminal tubes
provides a relatively simple and reason-
ably safe method of dealing with some
of the problems which arise in the man-
agement of patients with esophageal car-
cinoma.  such tubes would appear to be
of particular use in handling the prob-
lems of obstruction and regurgitation in
patients with incurable tumors, but may
also be helpful in preparing severely
debilitated patients with esophageal car-
cinoma to withstand the rigors of opera-
tion and radiation therapy.
