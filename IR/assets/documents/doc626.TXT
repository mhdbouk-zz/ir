relation of crying activity in early infancy to speech and intellectual
development at age three years
rosenfeld
cries of 38 infants, age 4 to 10 days, were measured for outburst
frequency during the most active 20-sec. period of crying.  crying
scores showed a significant correlation (.45) with stanford-binet iq
at 3 years, a borderline correlation (.32) with cattell iq at 15 to 20
months, and a nonsignificant trend with speech ratings at 3 years.
although no correlations were adequate for individual prediction,
infant crying is deemed worthy of further investigation as a possible
indicator of intellectual potential.
