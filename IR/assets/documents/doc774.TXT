surgical palliation for lung cancer
the results of resecting incurable lung cancer
in an effort to improve the terminal course of a
small number of patients are briefly presented.
this is not a comparative study and no in-
ferences or conclusions are justified regarding
the choice of this form of therapy as palliation
in preference to other forms of palliative ther-
apy; however we do believe that the terminal
course of the patient with lung cancer is bene-
ficially effected by removal of the primary
tumor whenever this is technically feasible.
