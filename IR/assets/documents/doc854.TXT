parathyroid extract-induced changes in the oxidation of citrate,
succinate and other organic acids by liver.
parathyroid extract (pte) or partially
purified parathyroid hormone administered in
vivo markedly altered the oxidation
in vitro by rabbit liver minces of citrate, -keto
glutarate-c, succinate-c, fumarate-c
and lactate.  with ca ++ present in the
incubation medium, minces from pte
treated animals produced more co and had
a greater o consumption than did control
minces.  this stimulation was due, in part
at least, to a more rapid decline in metabolic
activity of the control tissues.  when
ca++ was absent, total metabolism was
increased and the tissue derived from pte
treated animals was less active than the
control tissue.  the effect was detected as
early as 4 hr after injection (750 u/kg)
and could be elicited with as little as 200 u
(at 14 hr).  the action of pte could not
be duplicated by the injection of cacl into
the animal.  the data suggest that one effect
of treatment was a general inhibition of
oxidation.  the stimulation of metabolism
could be a consequence of this inhibition
or a separate unrelated alteration.
