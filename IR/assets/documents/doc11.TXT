STROMA CELL
but the authors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in the basement membrane and transport via the stroma cell.

BASEMENT MEMBRANE

FACTS
but the authors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in the basement membrane and transport via the stroma cell.

PINOCYTOSIS
pinocytosis is most representative, but the authors newly found several facts such as dissolution-like change in the basement membrane and transport via the stroma cell.

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY
almost all processes of fat permeation seem to be due to the biological activity.

NEUTRAL FAT
neutral fat can permeate through the human placenta without
