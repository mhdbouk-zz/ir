icterus neonatorum simplex.
studies in 50 guinea-pigs demonstrate that at
birth there is no activity of glucuronyltransferase.
after birth activity gradually
increases and reaches its highest
level on the 3rd day of life.  hereafter a gradual
decrease can be shown.  the suggestion
is made that glucuronyltransferase is
an adaptive enzyme.  the results
support the hypothesis that neonatal jaundice
is caused by an inability of the liver
of the newborn to excrete bilirubin.
