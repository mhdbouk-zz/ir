fibrin and thrombosis in the central nervous system
in children with particular reference to
congenital hydrocephalus
while rare metabolic and degenerative diseases of
the central nervous system in children are reported
at great length, the much commoner diseases
relating to vascular incidents are rarely discussed.
only those aspects of disease of the central
nervous system related to thrombosis and the
deposition of fibrin will be discussed here; diseases
related to general vasculitis and aneurysm are
omitted.  the conditions discussed here fall into two
main categories: first, the presence of thrombosis in
small blood vessels or in the large superficial veins
draining the brain, and second, the deposition of
fibrin either in the ventricles or on the membranes
overlying the brain in association with thrombotic
lesions, haemorrhage, or infiltration.
