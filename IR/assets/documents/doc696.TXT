the treatment of pituitary responsive
diabetes insipidus
in evaluating therapy in diabetes insipidus, it is important to note we
are altering only ten per cent of the reabsorption function of the kidney.
the kidney function in a case of diabetes insipidus is as efficient in its
activity as are biological tests.  the purpose of therapy is patient
convenience, economy, and normal function in society.  the diabetes insipidus
itself does not alter the life span, however, secondary factors may introduce
it into a health problem.
lysyl-8-vasopressin nasal spray is effective, offers a maximum of conve-
nience, and has produced no untoward reactions.
it is, as expected, ineffective in the treatment of extrapituitary (pituitary
unresponsive) diabetes insipidus.
