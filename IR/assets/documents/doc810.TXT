an analysis of the language of fourteen
schizophrenic children
fourteen schizophrenic (autistic) children were studied by means of detailed
behavioural histories and observations.
the language recorded in history and observation protocols was analysed and
compared with available data on normal children.
all schizophrenic children were grossly retarded in their language development
and all measures of this correlated highly with a previous overall clinical
assessment of the severity of illness.
the most striking abnormalities in the language of the children studied were
stereotyped repetition of utterances appropriate to an earlier developmental
level or to a previous environmental context, accompanied by a lack of normal
expressions of curiosity and of responsiveness to changing environmental cues.
