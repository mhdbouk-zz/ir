3604. cytotoxicity of organophosphorus compounds.  comparative activities of
trimethyl derivatives of thiophosphoric and selenophosphoric acids on vegetable
(pisum root) and human (hela) cells
of the 4 compounds studied, the seleno compounds were more cytotoxic for
hela cells than their thio analogues, whereas the activities on pisum
root cells were equal.  the parent phosphoric acid derivatives have a
wider activity range on hela cells than the seleno and thio derivatives.
further studies are in progress.
