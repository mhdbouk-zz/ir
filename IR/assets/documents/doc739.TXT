the periodicity of microfilariae
ix. transfusion of microfilariae (edesonfilaria) into
monkeys at a different phase of the circadian rhythm
this paper reports experiments in which microfilariae at one phase of their
circadian rhythm were transfused into a host at another phase of the circadian
rhythm, in an attempt to analyse the relative importance of the rhythms
inherent in the microfilariae and of those in the host for the production of
the well known periodic migrations.  the experiments were performed with
edesonfilaria malayensis (yeh, 1960) present in a macaca monkey from thailand.
