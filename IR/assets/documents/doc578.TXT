practical human growth hormone
preparation and clinical use
human growth hormone was prepared from
acetone-dried pituitary powder by hot glacial
acetic acid extraction and subsequent precipita-
tion by sodium chloride and cold acetone.  the
yield was 13 per cent and the preparation was
called practical growth hormone in recognition
of its complement of corticotropin.
treatment of two dwarfs with practical growth
hormone in aqueous solution, 1 or 2 mg intra-
muscularly on alternate days, accelerated the
growth rate and there were no physical signs or
laboratory indications of adrenal stimulation or
other adverse effects.  the preparation is recom-
mended for its safety, simplicity and relatively
good yield.
