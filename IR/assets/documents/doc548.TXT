the study of osteoporosis
and osteomalacia
radiological evidence strongly suggests that
osteoporosis (with the possible exception of acute
immobilization osteoporosis) may be an irrever-
sible condition.  the changes therefore to be
expected in calcium balance when an osteoporotic
is treated are small compared with those often
seen in osteomalacia.  methods of obtaining more
accurate calcium balances are needed to show
these small changes, especially when a high
calcium intake is used.  the method of continuous
marking of stools with chromium sesquioxide
seems to provide just such a method.  using this
method, it has so far proved impossible to obtain
prolonged large positive calcium balances in
osteoporosis on either high calcium intake,
anabolic hormones, or sodium fluoride.
two alternative therapies to vitamin d have
been explored for use in vitamin d-resistant
osteomalacia.  atp has been found to be inneffective.
intravenous phosphate alone has been ineffective
in producing positive calcium balances, but is
effective as a complement to vitamin d under
certain conditions.
