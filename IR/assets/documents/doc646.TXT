studies on mycoplasma pneumoniae
infection in sweden
sera from 107 cases of pneumonia and 132 cases of milder respiratory
infection were examined by the cf test against m. pneumoniae antigen.
thirty-five patients with pneumonia and 2 patients with bronchitis had
serologic evidence of m. pneumoniae infection.  all cases which had a
significant antibody rise with the cf test also showed a corresponding
rise with the fluorescent antibody test.  m. pneumoniae was isolated
from 10 of 18 serologically positive cases.  cold agglutinins were demon-
strated in 17 of 37 cases (46 per cent) with m. pneumoniae infection.
m. pneumoniae infections occurred during all seasons of the year and
were most common in older children and young adults.  the clinical
features of the cases with m. pneumoniae infection in this study re-
semble those described in similar investigations in other countries.
