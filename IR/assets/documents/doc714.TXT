intraventricular papilloma
a case of intraventricular papilloma of the left
lateral ventricle is reported.  craniotomy was
performed and removal of the tumor was ac-
complished without incident.
the literature is reviewed.
an unusual although perhaps relatively unim-
portant observation in the reported case was that
for four or five days postoperatively the patient,
a 17-month-old female, kept her head tilted to
the right but at the time she left the hospital she
was holding it erect and unsupported and was
sustaining weight satisfactorily on both feet.
