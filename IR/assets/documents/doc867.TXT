acute hyperparathyroidism: a surgical emergency.
   acute hypercalcemic crisis of hyperparathyroidism
is a surgical emergency.  diagnosis is often difficult
because of the polymorphous character of the
symptoms.  the variable clinical features of the syndrome
are described emphasizing the frequent occurrence of
gastrointestinal symptoms, especially duodenal ulcer of
recurring pancreatitis in the antecedent history as well
as the better known occurrence of renal and skeletal
manifestations, which precede the crisis in all but a few
cases.  despite the variability of the clinical manifestations,
the total syndrome forms a distinctive pattern
which should be recognizable once it is known.  previously
reported cases have been reviewed and an additional
case reported.  the differential diagnosis, aids
in identification of the tumor and prospects for more
effective control of the hypercalcemia are discussed.
at the present time, early surgical removal of the tumor
is the only effective treatment.
