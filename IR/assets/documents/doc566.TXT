relationship of maximal tubular phosphate
reabsorption to filtration rate in the dog
a maximal renal tubular rate of reabsorption of phos-
phate (tmp) has been demonstrated in the normal dog.  in
the dog, as in the man, considerable variability in the tmp
often occurs.  while some of this variability remains unex-
plained, a direct relationship between glomerular filtration
rate (gfr) and tmp can be demonstrated when the gfr is
varied over a wide range.  this relationship suggests that
glomerular intermittency may exist in the dog.
