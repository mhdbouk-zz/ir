insulin and insulin antagonism
as i said earlier, no simple answer
has yet emerged from the large amount of
research that has been directed toward determining
the nature of the substance or substances
responsible for the diabetes-inducing
and insulin-antagonizing actions of the
anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and to
ascertaining their mechanism of action.
growth hormone and corticotropin certainly
qualify, but so do any other factors that can increase the mobilization of fats
as plasma albumin-bound free fatty acids.  the idea
that the yet incompletely characterized insulin
antagonist in the pancreas may be
liberated into the blood under the influence
of growth hormone and may play a role in
the process by which growth hormone diminishes
the activity of insulin in promoting
the utilization of glucose is attractive to me,
but still remains to be confirmed.
