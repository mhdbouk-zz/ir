a fatal septicemic disease of infant puppies caused by
cytopathogenic organisms with characteristics of mycoplasma.
pathogenic organisms were iso-
lated from 2 outbreaks of a fatal septicemic
disease of infant puppies and from dog kidney
cells that degenerated spontaneously.  the iso-
lates were indistinguishable serologically and
possessed characteristics of mycoplasma.  the
pathogenic organisms were cytopathogenic for
dog kidney cell cultures, and in inoculated
puppies, produced pathological changes that
resembled those seen in natural cases.  le-
sions consisted principally of necrosis and
hemorrhage.  the isolates were culturally and
serologically distinct from recognized canine
mycoplasma species.
