therapy for hearing-impaired children
in comparison with the u.s.a. and
europe, canada is still in the early
stages of developing rehabilitative services
for speech and hearing-impaired
children and adults.  they are available
in some large canadian cities, but in
the opinion of the authors, these services
and more should be made available
to the hearing impaired of every canadian community.
specialists in the rehabilitation of
communication problems, along with
members of other medical, paramedical and social services, recognize
the vast variety of communication
problems that can occur in persons
of all ages, the tremendous handicap
that such problems represent to the
individual, the loss that such handicapped
persons represent to our society
and the pressing need for efficient and
effective rehabilitation.  more practically,
it is hoped that this article has
made its readers more aware of the
vast variety of rehabilitative procedures
available today for the hearing
impaired.  with a better understanding
of the problems of defective hearing,
it is hoped that all readers, professional
and non-professional, will join
in mutual support for the establishment
of these vitally needed services
in their respective communities.
