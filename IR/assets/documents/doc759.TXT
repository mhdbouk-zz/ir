galactosemie congenitale
this observation of a case of congenital galactosemia with
a particular familial incidence gives the opportunity of a
brief review on the subject.
of a certain point of view we must consider that galac-
tosemia is much more frequent than we suppose, that there
are many severe cases with a reserved prognosis, that even
with very slight degree of galactosemia, the disease must
receive the most careful attention from the pediatrician.
