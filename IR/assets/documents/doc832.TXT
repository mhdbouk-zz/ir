interet de la radiotherapie dans les hemarthroses
recidivantes du genou chez l'hemophile
radiotherapy was delivered at a dose of 100 r
repeated from 7 to 10 times, to 22 knees of haemo-
philiac children presenting recurring arthropathies.
irradiation had no harmful effect on growth of
patients; it was beneficial in two thirds of the cases,
reducing considerably the number per annum of
haemarthrosis onsets; one third of the patients
showed no significant result: the number of onsets
was the same in the following year.
totally the average of infirmary stays due to knee
haemarthrosis was 175 days in the year before radio-
therapy and 25 days in the following year.
the authors think that these results justify this
therapeutic method.
