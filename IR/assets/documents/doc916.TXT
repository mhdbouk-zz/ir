comments on a case of infantile psychosis.
an account is given of a case of infantile
mutism which depended not so much upon
a true autism as on a withdrawing into
himself as a defence against a dangerous and
threatening environment.  there was a
spectacular and unusual improvement of the
symptomatology with psychotherapy.
