growth-hormone deficiency in man:
an isolated, recessively inherited defect.
   a deficiency of human growth hormone not associated
with other pituitary deficiencies was observed in
midgets with sexual ateliosis, a form of dwarfism inherited
as an autosomal recessive trait.  body proportions,
sexual development, birth weight, and postpartum lactation
are normal in this syndrome.
