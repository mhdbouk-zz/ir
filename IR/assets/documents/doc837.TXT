klinik der polyarthrosen
among the degenerative affections of joints
the symptoms of the arthrosis of
the joints of the fingers with heberden-nodes,
the bouchard-nodes of the inter-
digital joints, the polyarthrosis - on those subjects
coste and forestier wrote about
and how they were described by lffb too - and the
arthropathies of chronic gout are
more thoroughly discussed.  the rare conditions,
as the arthrotic changes in hemo-
philia, psoriasis and metabolic disorders are
mentioned.  a wider area is dedicated
to the differentiation between degenerative and
inflammatory diseases.  it is refer-
red to, that gout more often occurs in our days
and one is forced to calculate with
it more than some years ago.  it is also referred
to the significance of the serolo-
gical reactions for the differential diagnosis.
the most important diseases are
enumerated, which do not belong to degenerative
polyarticular affections of joints,
but which very often get mixed up with them.
