human filariasis.  identification of species on the basis of staining
and other morphologic characteristics of microfilariae.
new staining procedures for human microfilariae
are described.  the morphologic
details characteristic of each species are
illustrated with apparent greater clarity
than previously obtainable.  a simple key
to the human microfilariae is outlined,
based on criteria clearly demonstrated with
these stains.
