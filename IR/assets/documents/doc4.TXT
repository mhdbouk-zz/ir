CORD BLOOD
determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol, triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born.

STILLBORN
determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol, triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born.

PLACENTA
the phospholipid content and the total lipid content of the stillbirth placenta were the highest studied in this laboratory which

INFANT
the serum of the stillborn infant contained one-third as much triglyceride and 21/2 times as much nefa as did the live-born infant.

LIVE-BORN
determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol, triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born.

NEFA
determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol, triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born.

TRIGLYCERIDE
determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol, triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born.

PHOSPHOLIPID
determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol, triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born.

OVUM
determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol, triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord blood in a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born.

LIPIDS
placental and cord blood lipids..

INTRAUTERINE FETAL DEATH
the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death.

LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE ACTIVITY
the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death.

INCREASED LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE
the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death.

SUGGESTION
the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activity in the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death.

LABORATORY
