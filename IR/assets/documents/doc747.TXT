ribonuclease activity in hepatic nuclei during development
mammalian liver undergoes marked qualitative and quantitative changes
during the development from the embryonic to the adult stage.  many of these
events are associated with the derepression or repression of certain enzymes
which may be related to specialized subcellular activity.  the involvement
of ribonucleic acid in the transcription of the information from the genome
into the construction of a finished protein molecule has prompted a study of
biosynthesis of the rna during differentiation.  although considerable effort
in this regard has been expended in amphibian1-5 and avian6,7 systems, as well
as in the sea urchin8-11, a paucity of literature exists with mammalian liver.
accordingly, an investigation of the alterations in rna metabolism which
occur during the development of the rat embryonic liver has been undertaken.
this report concerns the fluctuations in nuclear ribonuclease during hepatic
development and some of the properties of the enzyme.
