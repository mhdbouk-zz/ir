familial extrahepatic biliary atresia
a fifth family with familial congenital
extrahepatic biliary is described.
clinically and pathologically familial
and nonfamilial biliary atresia are similar
except for a predominance of males in the
familial condition.
the sex incidence and association of
other congenital anomalies is discussed in
relation to a possible etiology.  further in-
formation must be correlated and new facts
uncovered before the nature of this syn-
drome will be known.
