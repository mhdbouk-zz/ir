failure to thrive: the diencephalic syndrome of infancy and childhood
we have presented a case of a patient with an
astrocytoma of the optic chiasm who demonstrated
the features of the "diencephalic" or
"failure-to-thrive" syndrome.  overactivity, overalertness
and emaciation were significant symptoms
in this patient.  roentgenograms characteristically
demonstrate normal bone growth,
good muscular outline, and absent subcutaneous
fat.  increased growth hormone was found and
may be a factor in the disturbed lipid metabolism.
