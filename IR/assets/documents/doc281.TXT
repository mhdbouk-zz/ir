2431. histochemistry of surface epithelial and pleural mucins in mammalian
lung.  the demonstration of sialomucin in alveolar cuboidal epithelium
sialo- and sulfomucins have been demonstrated
histochemically in the surface
layer of the lung and pleura from rabbit,
syrian hamster, guinea pig, mouse, and
man.  sialomucin predominates in the distal
bronchial tree and covers the alveolar
epithelial surface.  the possible significance
of these observations is discussed.
