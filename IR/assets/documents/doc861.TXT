antagonism between parathyroid extract and adrenal
cortical steroids in man.
metabolic balance studies were done in 2
patients with hypoparathyroidism who
received hydrocortisone of prednisone
during the administration of parathyroid
extract.  administration of prednisone was
associated with phosphate retention,
decreased urinary ca, decreased serum
ca, citrate and glycoprotein concentrations,
and increased serum phosphate.
excretion of parathyroid activity in the
urine of 1 patient was uninfluenced by the
administration of prednisone.  it is concluded
that the antagonistic effect of the
adrenal cortical steroids was expressed
at the biochemical sites of action of the
parathyroid extract in bone and kidney,
that the steroids reduce parathyroid secretion
but that their administration probably does not
result in degradation or inactivation of
the hormone.
