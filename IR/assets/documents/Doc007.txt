When the video above starts, this wiggling, glowing blue blob seen under a new high-resolution microscope doesn’t look like much. But in just 26 seconds you and I can watch the blob’s tiny cells multiply, interact and organize into the first organ systems of a living mouse embryo.

The hollow crater forming on the left will give rise to the mouse’s stomach, pancreas and liver. The narrow white line stretching across the center of the image is the notochord, or an early backbone. And the contracting region on the far-left side of the image is the beginning of a heartbeat.

Researchers at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Research Campus in Ashburn, Va., built a new microscope that can trace individual cells’ origins and movement in real-time, sketching a virtual map of how mammals develop in the womb.
