“A lot of people are going over to the investment conference,” the president said. “Maybe some won’t be going.”

Asked in an interview with “60 Minutes” whether Crown Prince Mohammed gave an order to kill Mr. Khashoggi, Mr. Trump said, “Nobody knows yet, but we’ll probably be able to find out.”

He promised “severe punishment” for Saudi Arabia if it turns out that Mr. Khashoggi was killed by a Saudi hit squad in its consulate in Istanbul, as Turkish officials have said, according to excerpts from an interview that will be aired Sunday.
