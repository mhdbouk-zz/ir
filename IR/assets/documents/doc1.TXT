GLUCOSE
correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery.

CORRELATION
correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery.

DELIVERY
from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level.

FETAL FFA LEVELS
significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels.

FETAL PLASMA
correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels of glucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery.

DEPENDENT
from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level.

CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS
from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level.

SLIGHTLY DEPENDENT
from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level.

STRONGLY DEPENDENT
from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level.

REGRESSION
from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level.

SLOPES
from the size of the correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines it appears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very strongly dependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level at delivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level.

SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS
significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetal glucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels.
