language training in the treatment
of the autistic child
functioning on a retarded level
a preliminary study to
determine the effect of language and
speech therapy on the development of
communication and the lessening of un-
relatedness in a group of non-verbal,
autistic children functioning on a retarded
level is reported.  on the basis of the re-
sults of the study, it is suggested that the
inclusion of language and speech therapy
techniques be considered in developing a
treatment program for such children.
