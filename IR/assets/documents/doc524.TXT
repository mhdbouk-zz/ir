1142. sodium selenate toxicosis  pathology and pathogenesis of sodium
selenate toxicosis in sheep
the pathogenesis of selenium toxicosis was studied in 30 ewes fed subtoxic to
toxic levels of sodium selenate for 1 to 5 mth.  seventeen of the 30 died of
selenium toxicosis.  the most severe and consistent pathologic changes were
found in the myocardium and lungs.  myocardial alterations were focal to
diffuse degeneration, necrosis and early replacement fibrosis.  pulmonary
changes, consisting of edema and interstitial hemorrhages, were typical of the
degenerative processes which characterize passive congestion of the lungs
resulting from left ventricular insufficiency.  atrophy of lymphoid centers
in the spleen and lymph nodes was common.  degenerative changes were
occasionally found in liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract.
