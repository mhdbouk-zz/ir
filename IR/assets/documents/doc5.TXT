FREE FATTY ACID
the hypothesis is presented that the maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat accumulation.

MOTHERS
the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers.

BODY FAT
the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers.

PLASMA FREE FATTY
units of heparin into female sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose.

MATERNAL PLASMA
it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations.

FATTY ACID CONCENTRATION
the hypothesis is presented that the maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat accumulation.

FETUSES
the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers.

PREGNANT
a group of pregnant rats received such injections of heparin 3 times daily throughout pregnancy.

RATS
units of heparin into female sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose.

HEPARIN
units of heparin into female sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose.

INJECTION
subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p.

DIABETES
it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations.

BABIES
it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations.

BODY COMPOSITION CHANGES
it is proposed that the body composition changes noted in babies of mothers with diabetes might thus be ascribed to abnormally high maternal plasma free fatty acid concentrations.

FETAL FAT ACCUMULATION
the hypothesis is presented that the maternal free fatty acid concentration in part determines fetal fat accumulation.

UNINJECTED MOTHERS
the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers.

GESTATION
the fetuses from mothers of this group, at 191/2 and 211/2 days of gestation, had significantly more body fat than the fetuses from uninjected mothers.

BLOOD GLUCOSE
units of heparin into female sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose.

SUSTAINED ELEVATIONS
units of heparin into female sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose.

FEMALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS
units of heparin into female sprague-dawley rats produced large and sustained elevations of plasma free fatty acids but no significant change in blood glucose.

SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION
subcutaneous injection of 200 u.s.p.
