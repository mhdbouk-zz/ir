cell proliferation in compensatory renal growth
rats with one kidney removed showed a progressive increase in weight of the
remaining kidney over a six-week period.
autoradiographic and radiochemical studies with 3h-thymidine indicated that the
increase in new kidney cell formation was maximal forty-eight to seventy-two
hours after unilateral nephrectomy.  this early response was chiefly due to the
production of new cells by the renal cortical tubules.  normal rates of tubule
cell turnover were achieved two weeks after operation.  the glomerular tufts
contained fewer new cells and their peak production was delayed to the
one-week period with a slow decline thereafter.
rats forty-eight hours after unilateral nephrectomy were chosen as a model to
study the effect of various substances on the magnitude of new cell formation.
the number of dna-synthesising cells in the stimulated kidney was reduced by
treatment with hydrocortisone, acth, 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, and
1,2-benzanthracene; the numbers were increased by the administration of
deoxycorticosterone and aldosterone.
