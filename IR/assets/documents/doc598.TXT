growth hormone and diabetes mellitus
since the advent of insulin the vascular and neurological
lesions have replaced ketoacidosis as the major
problem in diabetes.  although good control of hyperglycemia
and glycosuria with diet and insulin may
influence favorably the development of the ocular angiopathy,
there remains a high incidence of these
lesions with resulting blindness despite such good
control.
growth hormone may be a major factor in the
pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus and its effects
may be a reflection of the genetic disturbance.  its importance
was first realized by the classical experiments
of houssay and those of young which revealed its
diabetogenic effects in experimental animals.  the association
of acromegaly with diabetes has been for a
long time the major argument in support of the hypothesis
of the diabetogenic effect of growth hormone
in man.
