1845. further studies on specific transplantation antigens in rous sarcoma of
mice
mice allografted with different sarcomas, induced by the schmidt-ruppin variant
of rous sarcoma virus (rsv-sr), showed a resistance against subsequent
isografting of 9 different rous sarcomas.  transplantation
resistance could also be induced by
rous mouse tumor cells x-irradiated with 8000 r
or with cell-free tumor extracts,
containing no demonstrable virus.  no
transplantation resistance could be demon-
strated after allograft pretreatment with
various polyoma tumors or non-viral tu-
mors.  allograft pretreatment with rous
tumors induced no demonstrable resistance
against isografting of polyoma tumors.
inoculation of rsv-sr or rous chicken sar-
coma suspension into adult mice gave
no clear cut resistance against isograft-
ing of mouse sarcomas.  neither after
allografting of rous tumors nor after virus
or chicken sarcoma inoculation into adult
mice could virus-neutralizing activity be
demonstrated in the sera.  the results
demonstrate the presence of common, speci-
fic transplantation antigen(s) in different
rous sarcomas in mice and speak against
an identity between the transplantation
antigen(s) and viral antigen(s).
