early infantile autism and receptor processes
the syndrome of early infantile autism is examined
as a function of deviation in
near-distance receptor usage.  these receptor
deviations are compared with normal
receptor hierarchies developing from near
to distance receptor dominance.  the
available information is consistent with the
view that early infantile autism involves
early sensory deprivation.  this sensory
deprivation results from an interaction
between a constitutional deficiency inhibiting
certain reticular arousal functions
and mothering tending to understimulation.
treatment of the young autistic child is suggested
including stimulation and communication
via the available near receptor
systems.  in the framework of sensory development,
directions for the study of early
diagnosis and treatment are indicated.
