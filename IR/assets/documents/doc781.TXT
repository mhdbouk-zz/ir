polyposis of colon
as seen in
private practice
familial polyposis of the colon may
present itself in a variety of clinical en-
tities.  from the cases discussed in this
paper the following forms may be enu-
merated:
(1) an asymptomatic phase with dis-
crete polyposis.
(2) a mildly asymptomatic stage
with diffuse polyposis.
(3) a premalignant phase with car-
cinomas in situ.
(4) grossly malignant phase char-
acterized by anemia and carcinomatosis,
possibly of multicentric origin.
to secure a complete cure it is im-
perative that the clinician discover and
the surgeon treat the disease in its pre-
malignant state.
worthwhile palliative results may be
obtained by surgery in incurable cases
by extensive resection of the primary
lesions and subsequent resection of any
recurrences or metastasis, whether local
or distant by second and third looks is
necessary.
special emphasis should be paid to
the emotional problems of the patients.
an encouraging, sympathetic attitude on
the part of the surgeon is essential and
rewarding.
