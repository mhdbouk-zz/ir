discussion sur les donnees radiologiques
dans les arthropathies des genoux
professor marchal acts as moderator.
dr. le coeur wonders if the fringed appearance of
condyles has really a pathological significance; that
appearance could be normal in young children, but,
in the opinion of dr. queneau, it seems to be patho-
logical in older children.
it seems to dr. favre-gilly and dr. queneau that
scalariform traits occur more frequently in haemo-
philiac children than in normal ones.
dr. le coeur thought that fibrillary decalcification
was the ultimate stage of decalcification, whereas
dr. favre-gilly has the impression that it represents
in haemophiliac subjects an early stage anterior to
homogeneous decalcification.
according to brinkhous, densification of synovial
membranes are a result of an infiltration of the joint
cartilage due to haemosideraemia; this is also the
opinion of dr. favre-gilly and dr. izarn.
dr. izarn asks if geodes are caused by intra-
osseous haemorrhages or necroses; dr. queneau and
dr. de mourgues think that anatomical data con-
cerning haemophiliac subjects are insufficient for
that question to be answered.
