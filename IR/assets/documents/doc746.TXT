central regulation of enzyme activity and synthesis
in embryonal and adult mammalian tissues
activity of non-specific hexokinase (hk) in soluble fraction and,
particularly, in mitochondria of embryonal liver is much higher than
in the adult rabbit; it decreases in the prenatal period, gradually
approaching adulthood values postnatally (fig.1).  embryonal liver
lacks specific glucokinase (gk) (1,2), although during the second half
of embryonic development there occurs incretion of insulin, known
to induce gk synthesis in the liver of alloxan diabetic animals (3,4).
activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6p dh) in
soluble liver fraction is subject to quite similar changes during
embryonic development.
