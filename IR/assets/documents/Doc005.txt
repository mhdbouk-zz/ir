“There will still be a lot of serious people in Riyadh,” said Jon B. Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Investors are going to be interested in Saudi Arabia for a long time to come,” he said, pointing to its extraordinary wealth and the fact that oil prices are above $80 a barrel.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is also still scheduled to represent the Trump administration, though on Friday, Mr. Trump told reporters that he might reconsider that decision. He said he planned to call King Salman to press him for answers about Mr. Khashoggi.
