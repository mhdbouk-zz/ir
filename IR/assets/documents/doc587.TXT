growth retardation accompanying diabetes insipidus: an additional
mechanism?
from the above considerations, we may divide patients with nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus into at least two categories: (1) those who fail to respond
to currently available therapeutic products as well as to their own presumably
normal secretion of adh; (2) those with similar similar unresponsiveness to
treatment but with presumably reduced secretion of adh.  the adh-growth hormone
theory may well account in part for growth retardation in the later group.
