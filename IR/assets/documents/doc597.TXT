effect of testosterone propionate and growth hormone on
growth and chemical composition of muscle and other
tissues in hypophysectomized male rats
the effect of testosterone
propionate and growth hormone on the
growth of muscle, bone, pelt, viscera and
seminal vesicles was studied in hypophysectomized
male rats.  testosterone (0.1 mg/day)
stimulated growth in the levator ani muscle
and seminal vesicles but had no effect on the
other tissues studied.  growth hormone (0.1
mg/day) accelerated growth in all tissues
except the seminal vesicles.  testosterone did
not enhance the growth-promoting effect of
growth hormone in any tissue except the
levator ani muscle.  growth hormone stimulated
deposition of myosin, sarcoplasmic
proteins, collagen and alkali-soluble proteins
in the thigh muscle of hypophysectomized
rats.  the composition of the muscle in treated
and control hypophysectomized rats was the
same as that in normal rats.  growth hormone
also increased the collagen, keratin-clastin
and globular protein content of the pelt.  the
effect of growth hormone on the proteins of
muscle and pelt was not enhanced by testosterone.
testosterone given alone had no effect
on the chemical composition or content of the
muscle and pelt in hypophysectomized rats.
