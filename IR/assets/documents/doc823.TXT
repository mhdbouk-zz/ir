discussion sur les pseudo-tumeurs osseuses
des hemophiles
doctors queneau and josso each described one
case of pseudo-tumour of the calcaneum analagous
to that described by trillat and favre-gilly; they
demonstrated x-rays; dr. alagille referred to a
haemophilic cyst of the maxilla and dr. favre-gilly
to a cyst of the perineum; dr. kugler had seen a
case where an erroneous diagnosis of osteosarcoma
had been made.
