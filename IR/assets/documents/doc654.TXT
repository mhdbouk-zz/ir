further studies of agents isolated from tissue cultures inoculated
with human leukaemic bone-marrow
d. a. woods
mycoplasmas were isolated from tissue cultures inoculated
with bone-marrow from leukaemic patients.
all cultures which showed a cytopathic effect contained
mycoplasmas.
there was no evidence of mycoplasmas in control cultures.
the mycoplasmas isolated seemed biologically and serologic-
ally to be of one strain which was different from any previously
reported as being isolated from human sources although there
was some relationship to a rodent mycoplasma, m. pulmonis.
mycoplasmas cannot readily be distinguished from viruses
electron-microscopically.
the relationship of mycoplasmas to leukaemia is not yet
clear.
