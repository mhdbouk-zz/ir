The team collected almost one million frames of each live embryo and compiled them, Dr. Keller said.

Using a cell-tracking program, they followed each individual cell through a critical 48-hour window — from six-and-a-half to eight-and-a-half days after fertilization — during which the embryo grows to about the length of a sesame seed and its vital organs begin to form.

Below, embryonic stem cells fold together to form a mouse’s heart. Each white dot is an individual cell, migrating to create an atrium, the endocardial membrane (the emerging “X” shape) and finally a heartbeat.
