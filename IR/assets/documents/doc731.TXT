the occurence of dirofilaria magnilarvatum price
and brugia sp. in philippine monkeys
of 356 macaca philippinensis examined, three were
found infected with dirofilaria magnilarvatum price, 1959.
one of these was infected also with a species of brugla.
both species showed a sub-periodic type of microfilarial
periodicity.  these observations suggest that philippine
macaques may serve as reservoirs for sub-periodic
b. malayi on palawan, where high rates of infection have
been found in people living in small villages in the
forests.  mansonia bonneae was found naturally infected
with third stage larvae of d. magnilarvatum.  it is sug-
gested that monkeys may serve as reservoirs for sub-
periodic b. malayi on the island of palawan, where high
rates of infection with this species have been observed
in people living in small villages in the forest.
