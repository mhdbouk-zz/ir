the action of oral diuretics
in diabetes insipidus
chronic administration of chlorothiazide and
other thiazide analogues in diabetes insipidus
results in a striking reduction in urinary volume
with increase in urinary osmolality.  this curious
antidiuretic action was first described by
crawford & kennedy (1959), and though it has
since been widely confirmed in both the pituitary
and nephrogenic forms of the disease, its precise
mechanism remains obscure.  a number of
investigators have sought to explain the phenom-
enon entirely on the basis of the renal actions of
these drugs (earley & orloff 1962, goodman &
carter 1962), whilst others have contended that
abatement of polyuria may be secondary to a
central effect of the thiazides in decreasing thirst
(robson & lambie 1962, skadhauge 1963).
over the past two years, we have conducted
detailed in-patient studies of the action of
various diuretic drugs of the thiazide and other
series in a group of 7 patients with pituitary
diabetes insipidus.
