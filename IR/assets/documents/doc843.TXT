the haemophilic pseudotumour
or haemophilic subperiosteal haematoma
the case history of a haemophiliac in whom a large haematoma of the thigh was
treated by amputation of the limb is described.
examination of the available radiographs and of the histology led to the
conclusion that the cyst was subperiosteal in origin.
evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that haemophilic pseudotumours
are always associated with subperiosteal haemorrhage, and that those
haemophilic cysts which are confined to muscle have little or no effect on the
adjacent bone.
