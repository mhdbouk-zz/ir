metabolism and excretion of c14-labeled bilirubin in children
with biliary atresia
and judson g. randolph
radioactive bilirubin was injected intravenously
into 3 children with biliary atresia.  the isotope
over a period of ten to fourteen days was recovered
principally in the urine.  sixty per cent of the label
in the urine was found to be in the form of bili-
rubin.  distribution of the radioisotope was observed
to be principally extravascular but not, as in other
forms of jaundice, in the same distribution as albumin.
daily turnover of bilirubin was several times greater
than the calculated normal daily production of bili-
rubin.  this was assumed to be due to increased
hemoglobin breakdown, confirmed by survival studies
of cr51-tagged red cells.  the serum half-life of intra-
venously administered radioactive bilirubin may have
useful prognostic value in children with biliary atresia.
