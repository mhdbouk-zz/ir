chlorambucil-prednisolone therapy
for disseminated breast carcinoma
over a 7 1/2-year period, 71 patients with
disseminated breast cancer were treated
with combined alkylating-agent-cortico-
steroid therapy.  chlorambucil and pred-
nisolone were the drugs of choice.  these
agents, administered orally, produced no
serious or disagreeable toxic effects.  twen-
ty-four patients (33.8%) had objective
regression of six months' duration or long-
er; average survival time after therapy
was 23.9 months.  results are statistically
similar to those obtained with sex-steroid
and endocrine-ablation therapy, presum-
ably because the three modalities have a
similar mechanism of action, ie. suppres-
sion and/or eradication of endogenous
estrogen.
