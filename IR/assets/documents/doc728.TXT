filariasis in portuguese timor, with observations on a new microfilaria
found in man
the results are described of an
investigation into filariasis in portuguese timor.
two types of microfilariae were
found in blood films: one was wuchereria bancrofti
and the other, referred to as the timor
microfilaria, is probably a new species.
blood surveys showed that w.
bancrofti and the timor microfilaria were widely
distributed in the territory but that infection
rates were usually low.
clinical lesions were few and mild;
elephantiasis was confined to oedema of the
lower limbs below the knee.
the timor microfilaria resembles
that of brugia malayi in general staining
reaction and appearance and in the possession
of two nuclei in the terminal thread, but
differs in over-all length, in cephalic-space ratio,
and in failure of the sheath to stain with
giemsa.  it is nocturnally periodic.  it was
rapidly removed from the peripheral blood
by treatment with diethylcarbamazine citrate
in daily doses of 9.3-13.3 mgm. per kgm. body
weight or 3.3-5.0 mgm. per kgm. body weight
for seven days.  only damaged fragments of
adult female worms were recovered.
the timor microfilaria was not
found in cats, dogs or monkeys.
the vectors of filariasis in timor
are still unknown.
