etude radiographique des genoux de 100 hemophiles
de 7 a 15 ans
radiographic examination of the knee were syste-
matically performed in 100 haemophiliac subjects
aged from 7 to 15 years, 64 of whom had a bilateral
haemarthrosis, 30 had only one knee affected and
6 were uninjured.
an intra-articular opacification, observed in
29 knees, corresponded to a recent haemarthrosis.
densification of the synovial membrane was ob-
served in 25 knees and corresponded to iron
deposits.
an interlinear pinch was present in 52 knees.
erosions of articular surfaces are especially fre-
quent (78 knees) or homogeneous (28 knees).
hypertrophy of condyles or knee-caps, broadening
of intercondylian space, crushing of internal tibial
disk, genu valgum and posterior subluxation of tibia
are osseous deformations that are encountered.
atrophy of femur diaphysis explains the frequency
of fracture of femur.
some of these aspects seem to occur early (inter-
linear pinch, erosion of the surfaces), others are
tardier (geodes, decalcification).
a relation between the intensity of abnormal radio-
logical findings and the severity of sequelae does
not always exist, but one can observe major radio-
logical alterations only when there is a major bio-
logical disturbance.
