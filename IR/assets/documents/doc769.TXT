linfangiografia no estudo da filariase linfatica
in the first part of the present paper a study is presented
of the lymphangiogram of the normal african; the author has
noticed that it is coincident with the one of the white indi-
vidual.
the second part includes the lymphangiographic examina-
tion and the observation of lymph circulation (via risa)
during the several stages of lymphatic filariasis.
even during the asymptomatic stage, lymphangiography
shows ganglial hypertrophy with a slight fibrosis and occa-
sional discreet alterations of the lymphatic trunks.
in the symptomatic stage, the lymphangiographic aspects
vary according to the disease's different stages and there is
not always a relationship between the duration period of the
symptoms and the changes observed.
in lymphangites, there are frequent alterations of the
lymphatic trunks, i.e., increase in caliber, extensive and seg-
mentary dilatations, numerical decrease with visualization of
anastomoses and higher permeability.  circulatory trouble evi-
dences itself not only by a decrease in the rate of the lymph
flow, but also by a very marked ganglial retention.
in adenites, in spite of the marked ganglial hypertrophy
due to intense sclerosis, there may be no considerable altera-
tions in the lymphatics, but risa already shows clear circula-
tion troubles leading to lymphatic stasis.
in adenolymphoceles, the obstruction at the primitive-iliac
level causes the lymph flow to deviate through the pre-sacral
anastomoses and reflux to the inguinal glands, thus causing
their dilatation and the formation of varicosities in the affe-
rent lymphatics.
in lymphedemas, our lymphangiographic results together
with risa's allow us to assume that the pathogeny is chiefly
influenced by three factors: lymphatic obstruction due to lym-
phangitis, insufficiency of the collateral ducts, and ganglial
sclerosis.
