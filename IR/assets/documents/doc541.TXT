5514. the incorporation of sv40 genetic material into adenovirus 7 as
measured by intranuclear synthesis of sv40 tumor antigen
the l.l. strain of adenovirus 7, free of
detectable infectious sv40 virus, induced
sv40 tumour antigen, demonstrable by
fluorescent antibody staining, in green mon-
key kidney, rabbit kidney, hamster embryo
and human embryo kidney cell cultures.
in green monkey and human cell cultures
there was a cytopathic effect and more
cells contained the sv40 tumour antigen
than in the other types of culture.
adenovirus 7 viral antiserum neutralized
the sv40 tumour antigen inducing
ability of the l.l. strain virus but anti-sv40
monkey serum and serum from sv40
tumour bearing hamsters did not.  an
adenovirus 7 preparation propagated
exclusively in human tissue did not induce
the sv40 tumour antigen.  the sv40
tumour antigen was entirely localised within
the cell nuclei and appeared to be
transmitted to daughter cells during mitosis.
