pattern of serum transaminase activity
in neonatal jaundice due to cytomegalic inclusion
disease and toxoplasmosis with hepatic involvement
the pattern of serum transaminase ac-
tivity that evolved in a newborn infant with
congenital toxoplasmosis and in another new-
born infant with congenital cytomegalic in-
clusion disease is described.  this enzymatic
pattern was unlike that found in infants with
any other cause of neonatal jaundice studied
to date.
