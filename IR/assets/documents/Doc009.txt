For all the differences between Davos and Riyadh, the Saudi conference, officially known as the Future Investment Initiative, was first proposed through an invitation delivered to participants in the 2017 Davos meeting, held by the World Economic Forum.

“The FII offers a significant opportunity to engage with what will soon be the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, and a monumental force in the world of global investment,” said a follow-up email sent by the organizers in April 2017 to one of the invitees.
