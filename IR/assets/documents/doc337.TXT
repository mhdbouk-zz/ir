2596. experimental nickel contact sensitization in man
in 16 of 172 male prisoners contact-type
delayed hypersensitivity was induced
experimentally by repeated application of
25% nicl2 in a 0.1% sodium lauryl
sulphate solution on the skin.  test reactions
with 5% nicl2 with occlusion
were found to be irritating.  no experimentally
sensitized subject demonstrated
clinical sensitivity to the metal in his environment.
