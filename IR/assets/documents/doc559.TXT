mediastinal parathyroid adenoma
a case of hyperparathyroidism with hypercalcemic crisis is presented.  the
tumor was a well differentiated and encapsulated parathyroid adenoma, un-
usually located in the anterior mediastinum, lying both within and without
the pericardial sac.  the surgical approach was directly through the sternum
with a mediastinal exploration.  the postoperative course was uneventful and
gratifying, with complete correction of both symptoms and abnormal laboratory
findings.
