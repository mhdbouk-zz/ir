effect of parathyroidectomy and ferric dextrin
upon calciphylactic sensitization by uremia
experiments on the rat indicate that calciphy-
lactic sensitization can be achieved by bilateral
nephrectomy.  intravenous administration of a
ferric dextrin preparation (fe-din) induces
selective calcification in the buccal mucosa,
esophagus, trachea and mediastinum of the
nephrectomized rat although it produces no such
changes in intact control animals.  conversely,
fe-din prevents the cardiovascular calcification
normally elicited by nephrectomy.  parathy-
roidectomy protects the nephrectomized rat
against the fe-din-induced calciphylaxis.
hence, it may be concluded that: 1) autologous
parathyroid hormone, in amounts secreted by
the glands, can act as a calciphylactic sensitizer
and 2) fe-din is highly effective in protecting the
cardiovascular system against uremic damage.
