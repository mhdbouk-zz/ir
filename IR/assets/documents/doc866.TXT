albright's hereditary osteodystrophy.  report of a family with studies
of bone remodeling.
   two members of a single family, each representing
different forms of albright's hereditary osteodystrophy,
have been presented.  the kindred pattern is
similar to those of other reported families and is consistent
with a sex-linked or autosomal dominant mode of
inheritance.  the importance of a course of intramuscular
parathyroid extract for proof of parathyroid hormone
resistance is emphasized.  biopsy specimens of rib,
labeled in vivo with tetracycline, were studied microscopically.
these new observations indicated cellular
defects in bone remodeling shared by the propositus and
case 2, which may explain the low rates of bone turnover
found in each.  immunologic studies established the
presence of a substance antigenically similar to parathyroid
hormone in the parathyroid tissue of the propositus.
the pathogenesis of albright's hereditary osteodystrophy
and atypical forms of parathyroid hormone
resistant hypocalcemia is discussed.
