reviewed, 53 patients (46 percent) had symptoms and signs of central    
nervous system or cranial nerve involvement . thirty-nine patients had  
both cerebral manifestations and neuropathy, 38 had neuropathy alone,   
and 14 had only cerebral symptoms and signs .

hemiparesis, and signs of a brainstem lesion . there was no difference  
in duration of life, after onset of disease, in those with and those    
without central nervous system involvement .
