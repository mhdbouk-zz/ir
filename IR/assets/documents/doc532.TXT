2570. treatment of canine neoplasms with autogenous vaccinial preparations
inbred mice with transplantable sarcoma
and carcinoma were treated with im-
plants of their tumours which had been
grown in strains of mice normally resistant
to the tumours.  complete regression of
transplantable tumours was noted in 22%
of the treated mice and 78% had life
spans double that of untreated controls.
one dog with spontaneous scirrhous
mammary carcinoma and another with
lymphosarcoma were treated with implants
of their own tumours after growth in
cortisone-treated mice.  regression of the
spontaneous neoplasms followed in both
cases.  it is suggested that growth of a
neoplasm in a foreign host alters the mole-
cular structure of the neoplasm, making it
antigenic when returned to the original
host.  antigens produced are also effective
against the original lesions.
