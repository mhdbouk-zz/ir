diabetes insipidus treatment with 8-lysine vasopressin in a nasal spray.
synthetic 8-lysine vasopressin administered
as a nasal spray to 3 patients with diabetes
insipidus resulted in excellent control
in one.  in the other 2 it was of some
value as therapy supplemental to pitressin
tannate in oil.  the patient who was
adequately controlled with 'spray therapy' alone
required the sprays every 3 hr. during
the day, but none during the night.
