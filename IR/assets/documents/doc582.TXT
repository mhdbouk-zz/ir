recent advances in physiology of bone: part i
our introductory textbook summarizes knowledge of the biochemistry and
physiology of bone and calcium metabolism up through 1960.  in this lecture,
we will outline a few important advances appearing since that time.  references
to the original literature need not be repeated here.  the
object is to bring some of the subjects we are investigating up-to-date and
to present new problems for laboratory research.  the hypothetical new hormone,
calcitonin, of copp and cameron will be discussed in detail in dr. mclean's
lecture on the parathyroid glands and bone.
