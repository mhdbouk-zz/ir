hypoglycemia and dwarfism associated with the isolated
deficiency of growth hormone.
the authors have studied a 7-year-old dwarfed
boy with a history of severe, recurrent
hypoglycemic episodes since age 1 and
retarded bone age.  hepatic, adrenal,
and thyroid function were normal.  he demonstrated
fasting hypoglycemia with blood
sugars of 30-40 mg./100 ml.  he was not sensitive
to l-leucine but showed insulin
sensitivity and hypoglycemic unresponsiveness.
glycogenolysis in response to both
adrenaline and glucagon was appropriate.  fasting
plasma gh levels were less than
1 m g./ml. (normal 1-3), and no rise was seen
after insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
similarly, these low gh levels did not rise 3-6
hr.  after a glucose tolerance test.
treatment with hgh reversed the alterations
in carbohydrate metabolism.  it is
concluded that the patient suffered from an isolated
gh deficiency which resulted in
dwarfism and alterations in carbohydrate metabolism.
