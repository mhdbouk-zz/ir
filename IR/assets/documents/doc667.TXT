compensatory renal enlargement
hypertrophy versus hyperplasia
after unilateral nephrectomy in the mouse, the compensatory growth
of the remaining kidney is characterized by an increase in rna and
protein synthesis within the first hour.  dna synthesis remains un-
changed for about 18 hours and then rises to a maximum at 48 hours.  by
the end of the fifth day, when dna synthesis has passed its peak and is
in decline, cellular hyperplasia has accounted for only one-fourth of the
increase in kidney weight.  thus it is shown that cell hypertrophy is both
the primary and the predominant response in the early phase of compen-
satory renal enlargement.
