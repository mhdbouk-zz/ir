the effect of growth hormone in hypothalamo-pituitary
dwarfism. i. the metabolic effects of human growth hormone.
human growth hormone, isolated by raben's
method, was given in 2 to 5 mg. daily
doses over periods from 1 to 12 days to 7 patients
with pituitary-hypothalamic dwarfism.
the metabolic effects were as follows:
nitrogen retention with a variable
reduction in blood urea.  the plasma amino-acid
concentration did not alter after
i.m. injection of the hormone during fasting.
an accompanying retention of intracellular
components, in such proportions required
for protoplasm formation.
isotonic expansion of the extracellular compartment,
without change in the plasma
electrolyte concentrations.  retention of phosphorus,
sometimes a rise in plasma
phosphate; increased intestinal calcium absorption,
hypercalciuria, no alteration
in plasma calcium; an increase in plasma citrate
and citrate urinary excretion;
the calcium and phosphate retention was reversed
on stopping treatment.  mobilisation
of fat stores with lipid catabolism: this
was accompanied by a well marked
increase in nefa concentration for some hours
after hormone injection in the
fasting state, after a period of hypoglycaemia
and low nefa levels.  a complex,
biphasic action on glucose metabolism.  fasting
blood sugar levels are altered,
as are the glycaemia in various tests such as
fasting, insulin injections, tolbutamide
administration, intestinal hyperglycaemia.
acceleration of intermediate
metabolism with increased blood citrate
concentrations and 24 hours urinary
excretion of  -ketoglutaric acid.  in one test
during fasting the blood citrate increased
4 hours after hormone injection.  after
an oral load of sugar the blood citrate
and  -ketoglutaric acid concentrations
did not alter.  a progressive gain in
weight has been found during treatment, partly
reversible on stopping treatment,
correlating with the intracellular nitrogen retention
and expansion of the extracellular
space, despite mobilisation of fat reserves.
