autistic reactions in early childhood:
differential diagnostic considerations
the term "autism" is frequently used today
in the differential diagnosis of the severe
emotional disturbances of early childhood.
however, to label a child as "autistic"
presents some formidable problems with
regard to definition of the term, the specific
etiological-diagnostic implications, and
treatment considerations for any given
child so designated.  the purpose of this
paper is to briefly review some of the
historical psychiatric background of the term
"autism", its more recent ramifications,
and our clinical experiences in this field.
