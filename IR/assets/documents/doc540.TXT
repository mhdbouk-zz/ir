5512. antigenic properties of human tumours
preliminary studies on the antigenic
properties of human tumours have been
carried out using heterologous antisera,
prepared in rabbits, against a number of
different cancerous and normal tissues.
after repeated absorptions, antisera
were obtained which reacted only with
tissue antigens.  some antisera, after ab-
sorption with normal tissues, reacted only
with tumours.  seventy-two tumour and
31 normal tissue extracts were studied
by means of the ouchterlony agar gel
double diffusion technique.  the results
showed the presence of an antigen or
antigens in some human malignant tumours
which were not detectable in normal
tissues, in foetal tissues, or in hela cells.
in addition, there was some loss of
normal tissue antigens from tumours.
attempts are being made to isolate and
characterize these tumour and normal
tissue antigens.
