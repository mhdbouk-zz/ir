psychodrama for disturbed children
psychodrama is especially adaptable to the treat-
ment of mentally ill children.  it evokes a degree
of spontaneity and involvement that is difficult to
attain with many group therapies, and it offers situa-
tions in which the children can participate as actors
or as observers.  competition and restriction are
minimal: the child can do what comes naturally.  in-
deed, much of children's natural play is in the form
of dramatic activity.  their make-believe is, how-
ever, more intense than acting, for a child becomes
the person or thing he pretends to be: a fireman,
an indian, a horse, a tiger.
