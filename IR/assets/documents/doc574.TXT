transport of insulin, as well as of the behavior of agents which interfere with
the actions of the hormone by inhibition or destruction.  we shall deal with a
variety of these problems here and it might be helpful at the outset to outline
first our present understanding of the chemical structure of insulin since
many useful hints flow out of a consideration of the nature of the molecule.
