haemophilic blood cyst
a mongol boy of ten, a known haemophiliac, was seen in the orthopaedic
department of southmead hospital in may 1962 with a swelling of the left foot.
the parents were aware of a steady increase in size since the swelling was
first noticed two months before.  on examination, a cystic swelling was seen to
occupy the forefoot, the skin on the dorsum being stretched over it and a
dusky red in colour (fig. 1).  radiographs showed destruction of the proximal
two-thirds of the third metatarsal bone, an appearance consistent, it was
thought with destruction from within by an expanding lesion (fig. 2).  the
diagnosis of a haemophilic blood cyst was made.
