264. fluorescent antibodies to human cancer-specific dna and
nuclear proteins
specific antigens have been demonstrated
in certain cancers.  in this study they were
obtained from an adenocarcinoma of the
colon and an ewing's sarcoma.  homogenates
were prepared and male rabbits were
immunized.  the animals were bled to death
10 days after the last injection.  testing
included fluorescent antibody methods and
agar-gel horizontal double-diffusion precipitin
test.  the pattern of reaction of these
antibodies against various cancers seems to
be dependent upon the source of the
cancerous dna-bound proteins and the salt
concentration used in their isolation.
human cancer-specific cross nuclear antigens
seem to be cross reacting rather
than identical in structure.  the cancer-specific
antibodies could be removed only
with absorption of the immune globulins with
cancerous tissues.  salt-soluble human
dna-bound proteins from an adenocarcinoma
of the colon and an ewing's sarcoma
induced the formation of cancer specific
antibodies which showed positive fta re-
actions (to a maximum titer of 1/128) against
95% of the cancerous tissues studied.
these cancer-specific antibodies gave
similar fta reactions with cell nuclei of
normal appearing liver parenchyma
adjacent to metastatic carcinoma of colon, nor-
mal appearing colon near to metastatic
carcinoma of the colon, normal appearing
colon near to carcinoma of the colon,
and a long-standing case of chronic ulcerative
colitis.  evidence is shown that this finding
possibly may represent a serological
detection of an early or latent cancerous
change in morphologically normal cells.
these cancer-specific antigens have been
identified as rounded, intranuclear dna-
bodies and nuclear proteins which can be
specifically destroyed by dnase trypsin.
