the age factor in experimental hypertension
of the dca type in rats
rats aged 25 and 86 days were sensibilised by unilateral nephrectomy and a week
later were given 1.1 mg/100 g dca every third day for 6 weeks and a 1% nacl
solution to drink.  the younger rats reacted with a greater increase in blood
pressure, more so male rats.  hypertrophy of the heart and kidneys and
mortality and supression of growth were also all more evident in the younger
age group.  only male rats given the steroid hormone starting from day 25
showed permanent suppression of growth.
