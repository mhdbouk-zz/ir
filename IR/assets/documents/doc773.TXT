adjuvant cancer chemotherapy
development of a dosage schedule for adjuvant cancer chemotherapy
in surgical cases
an account is given of the development
of a dosage schedule for adjuvant can-
cer chemotherapy for surgical patients.
this treatment was administered for
two purposes:
as an adjuvant to radical surgery
to reduce the risk of blood-borne
metastases.
as a palliative measure for non-ra-
dically operated and inoperable pa-
tients.
for these purposes 3 dosage levels
were fixed:
a maximum tolerated dose for ad-
juvant therapy.
a maximum tolerated dose for pa-
renteral palliative therapy.
a maximum tolerated dose for oral
palliative therapy.
for this treatment the authors used
2 antimitotics, sp-i and sp-g, both of
which are podophyllin derivatives.
