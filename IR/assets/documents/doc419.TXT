4613. selective brain cooling produced by cerebral ventricular perfusion
hypothermic cerebral ventricular perfusion
was applied to dogs.  shivering appear-
ed to be directly related to the cns temperature
rather than the peripheral body
temperature.  selective heating of the brain-stem
produced panting.  rewarming
of the body was retarded by the initiation of heat
loss mechanisms controlled cen-
trally when hyperthermic perfusion was used.
shivering disappeared but panting
was unaffected by pentobarbital anesthesia.
cooling of one or both frontal areas and
the anterior part of the third ventricle did not
significantly affect the respiratory
or circulatory systems but brain-stem hypothermia
produced distinct respiratory
and circulatory reactions.  it is suggested that
cooling of the 3rd and 4th ventricu-
lar areas may be utilized for anesthetic purposes.
