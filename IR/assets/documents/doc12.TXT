CONCENTRATIONS
the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values.

as compared to the liver of adult rats, the fetal liver contains a little less than 50 per cent lipid phosphorus.

ADULT RATS
the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values.

COLAMINE CEPHALIN
thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat liver showed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase of the esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the content of free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined (lecithin, colamine cephalin, sphingomyelin and lysolecithin).

LECITHIN
thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat liver showed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase of the esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the content of free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined (lecithin, colamine cephalin, sphingomyelin and lysolecithin).

FRACTIONS

LIPID PHOSPHORUS
thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat liver showed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase of the esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the content of free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined.

PLACENTAS
the content of phosphatides, triglycerides and cholesterol in placentas, maternal, fetal and new-born liver of the white rat.

PREGNANCY
solely the content of free cholesterol is higher at the end of pregnancy.

PLACENTA CORRESPOND
phospholipid- and triglyceride concentrations of the placenta correspond to those of the fetal liver.

LEADS
the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values.

MILK FOOD
the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values.

INFLUENCE
the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values.

BIRTH
the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult rats occurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which, moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values.

SLIGHT RISE
referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of all phosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slight rise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day.

DECREASE
referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of all phosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slight rise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day.

DRY WEIGHT
referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of all phosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slight rise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day.
