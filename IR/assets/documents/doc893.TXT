acquired aphasia in children.
this report concerns the cases of 21 boys
and 11 girls studied over a period of several
years while rehabilitation was carried
out.  the general conclusions fall under
3 headings: (1) symptomatology as compared
with that of aphasia in the adult; (2) the
course of the disorder; (3) prospects of the
level of intellectual performance in the
future of the children.  in 13 cases, cerebral
damage had resulted from traumatic
contusion; in 10 cases from an intracranial
nontraumatic hematoma (vascular malformation,
aneurysm or angioma); in 2 cases
the aphasia followed operation for a
cerebral astrocytoma; in 2 further cases
occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery
had occurred; and in the remaining 5 cases
no precise diagnosis was made.
