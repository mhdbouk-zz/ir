the use and mode of action of ethacrynic acid
in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
the use of diuretic agents in the treatment
of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus had been re-
ported to result in decreased urine volume
and decreased clearance of free water.  a
study of the use of ethacrynic acid, a potent
saluretic agent, was instituted in patients
with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in an
attempt to achieve a significant antidiuretic
response while allowing a liberal sodium diet.
intravenous ethacrynic acid resulted in de-
creased urine volume, decreased clearance of
free water and decreased rpf and gfr.
prolonged oral administration of ethacrynic
acid promoted a significant antidiuretic re-
sponse when the daily sodium intake was
limited to 60 meq.  the effect of ethacrynic
acid on renal function, potassium and chlo-
ride excretion, and uric acid metabolism are
discussed.
