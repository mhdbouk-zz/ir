terminal cancer nursed at home
perhaps the most difficult part of mrs. brown's illness,
was that she herself knew all about it.  she had been a
nurse for most of her working life, and was only too aware
of the deteriorating process of carcinoma.  there were
times, of course, when she would try to deceive herself, say-
ing that there was always hope that something new in the
way of treatment would turn up, and life would then be
worth living again.
