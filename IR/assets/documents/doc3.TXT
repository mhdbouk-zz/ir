FLUID
analysis revealed that this fluid contained material high in surface activity in lambs delivered near term, but less surface activity in premature lambs.

ACTIVE COMPONENT
two analyses of the fetal tracheal fluid revealed it to contain 146 and 198 mg. of lipid per 100 ml., 30 to 40 per cent of which was phospholipid, part of the active component of surfactant.

PHOSPHOLIPID

SURFACTANT PROPERTIES
administration of 10 per cent oxygen to the ewe for 1 hour prior to delivery did not alter the surfactant properties of the fetal tracheal
