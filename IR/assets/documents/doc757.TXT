les icteres du nouveau-ne en dehors
de l'incompatibilite foeto-maternelle
statistical data pulled off a study of 30 haemolytic neonatal icteri
not linked to a foeto-maternal incompatibility, and of 200 non haemo-
lytic neonatal icteri.  among this latter, the two most important groups
are the malformative icteri (69 cases) and the neonatal hepatitis
(109 cases).  the difficulties of the diagnosis frequently rencountered
between these two groups clearly appear in the comparative statistical
analysis of the clinical, histological and evolutive data.
