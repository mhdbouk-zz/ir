3640. poisoning with sodium selenite
chronic poisoning with na selenite (in the drinking water) causes hepatic
cirrhosis, usually of atrophic type, in rats.  in rabbits there seems to be a
definite diabetogenic action, while attempts to demonstrate such action in
dogs have so far given inconclusive results.  the difference between these
2 species is perhaps due to the technique used (different spacing of injections
for practical reasons).  the action of selenite on the pancreas is discussed
and it is pointed out that se can replace s in sh groups, thus rendering the
latter ineffective.  both in effects on the liver and in those on the pancreas
se seems to resemble alloxan.
