hypertensive vascular disease produced by homologous renin.
administration of rat renin to uninephrectomized
rats reproduced most, if not all,
the changes (hypertension, vascular disease,
hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa
of the adrenals) found after partial constriction
of the renal artery.  this is taken
as evidence that the renal pressor system
plays a major role in the pathogenesis
of renal hypertension.
