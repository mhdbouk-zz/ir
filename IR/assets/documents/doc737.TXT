attempts to transmit wuchereria bancrofti to cats and to a toque monkey
there are no records of the larval development of wuchereria bancrofti in
experimental animals.  in attempts to transmit periodic w. bancrofti to
domestic cats and to a toque monkey we recovered from one of the cats an
infective larva that had undergone some development.  this finding was
reported in a preliminary note (dissanaike and niles, 1963); the present paper
gives the experimental details and describes the larva.
